          Taylor aims to improve everyday and to "Learn, practice, teach".
        </div>
        <p>Considered a hands on professional who likes to get things done, he has a background in mission critical and high-pressure
          environments that has taught him to be detailed oriented, work in a team-first culture and how to think outside
          of the box to solve challenges.</p>

        <h6>What is unique about you?</h6>
        <p>If I had to choose just one thing, I would zero in on my ability to understand the spirit of vague requests and translate
          that back to both the internal and external stakeholders in a way everyone can understand, both technical and non-technical.</p>
        <h6>If you were a car brand, what would you be and why?</h6>
        <p>Toyota. Ultimate reliability with no shortcuts on quality. Toyota also has a reputation for practicality and attention
          to detail, something I can relate too. It may not be the flashiest on the inside, but they make sure to place everything
          right where you need it. </p>
        <h6>How do you make Software design decisions?</h6>
        <p>That's easy. Look at your data. What is it telling you? Are your users on mobile, desktop or tablet? What are your
          event's telling you, do they say your users are getting stuck on a certain page in the flow? Listening to the data
          you have available to you is the easiest way to make sure you're investing in the right place.</p>
        <h6>What is your claim to fame?</h6>
        <p>I wouldn't exactly call it fame, but way back before CodeAcademy existed... there was HTMLGoodies. I had started
          learning HTML in 1997 and primarily used FrontPage. Discovering HTMLGoodies helped me make the transition to manual
          HTML instead of WSYWIG. I wrote the author to let him know how appreciative I was and he was kind enough to
          <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HAZ99JCo-JAC&pg=PT4&dq=htmlgoodies+ackley&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwia1reRuODPAhUIs1QKHQSoAU8Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=htmlgoodies%20ackley&f=false">acknowledge me in his book.</a>
        </p>
        <p>Somehow I also ended up in a heating and a/c company commercial, but we don't talk about that :)</p>
        <h6>How do I get started in computer forensics?</h6>
        <p>First, computer forensics is nothing like what you see on TV, or all trial technology for that matter (Looking at
          you
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_(2016_TV_series)">Bull</a>). Computer Forensics can be divided into two camps, Civil and Criminal. I can't speak for the latter,
          but for the short while I was in the field, it was extremely challenging and I loved every minute of it. Each collection
          brings new and unique challenges that will take your technical and preparation skills to the max. I was primarily
          involved with the processing and facilitating of collections, though I did do one or two myself. To get started
          in computer forensics, your best bet is to start out as an analyst at a e-discovery company. To advance and get
          far in the field, it will help if you have all of your Cisco and MCSE Certifications.
          <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/digital-forensics">The UW also has a certificate program.</a> Good Luck!</p>
        <h6>Do you have a favorite website?</h6>
        <p>I have a certain affinity towards
          <a href="http://www.quora.com" target="_blank">Quora</a>. The variety of information and quality of the answers makes it easy to find answers to questions you
          never thought to ask. I also admire
          <a href="http://www.unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a>. They offer free do whatever you want stock photographs that are extremely high quality. They make
          sure great hero background images, but I find myself browsing the images endlessly and simply admiring the beautiful
          photos.
        </p>
        <h6>I heard you have a weird response to the question "What is your weakness?" Is that true?</h6>
        <p>What is this, a job interview!?! All kidding aside, I happen to think this is a very interesting question that yields
          interesting responses. Many people try and spin a supposed strength as a weakness, for example "I am too detail
          oriented!" While that can be a sort of weakness since worrying about only details can mean a project never gets
          off the ground, it's not really the point of the question. Really, the answer is much more simpler than most people
          want to believe. We all have skill deficits, for example I have awful handwriting, but thats doesn't really the
          answer the question either. The truth is, we all have the same weakness, we're human. We make mistakes, we misjudge,
          we fall down. It's what you do about the mistakes that matter, learn from them and move on.</p>

        <p>After identifying a gap in our product offerings, I demonstrated intraprenuership and endevoured to fill the gap
          by creating

          WeatherApp
        </div>
        <p>As a means to experiment with presenting data in different ways I built a small weather application that uses the
          Dark Sky API to display the weather. I chose to use Angular 1.5 to start getting used to using components. Lastly,
          I revamped my gulp file to serve up a static site and work on improving my front-end workflow skills.

        <h1>What am I Learning?</h1>
        <p class="blockquote">Currently, I am learning and practicing ES6 and Karma/Jasmine.</p>
        <p>ES6 is the way forward and I enjoy using it. Specifically, the let and const variable types have signifcantly improved
          my programs.</p>
        <p>Quality Assurance testing is invaluable, but only useful when they don't spend the majority of their time stuck in
          regression testing. The benefits of using Karma/Jasmine are obvious and help improve the speed of usability testing
          and overall quality.</p>
